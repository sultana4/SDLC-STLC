# SDLC-STLC
<h3 align="center">The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) are crucial components within the field of software engineering. The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is comprehensive and includes 6 stages: requirement analysis, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. However, STLC is a part of SDLC. It has a specific focus, particularly targeting the testing stage of SDLC. The main objective of STLC is to guarantee the quality, functionality, and reliability of software through different testing activities.</h3>
